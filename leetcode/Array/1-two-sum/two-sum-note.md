# Solution

## Approach 1: Brute Force

To use two loops to find the answer.

* Time complexity: O(n^2)
* Space complexity: O(1)

## Approach 2: Two-pass Hash Table(better)

To use a hash table to store the number and its index. Then, use another loop to find the answer.

* Time complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: O(n)
